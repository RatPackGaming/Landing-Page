        Coming in at 91 lbs, the absolute unit, Comet the Lomet. One the fluffiest goldens of all time willing to bark at anyone on the other side of the fence. But is he up to the task of defeating the other competitors?

      <p>
        The cream golden retriever, Nova the Slova, coming in at 62 lbs and full of fluff and fury. She demands pets more than anything else in this world and piercingly stares into your soul if they are not granted. But her skitishness might be her downfall.

        Our final competitor, a random seagull from Rome, might be the toughest one yet. Sitting upon the ledge of Castel Sant' Angelo, he lurked with no fear of any passerby. Legend has his look is enough to fell the mightiest foes.
